The Property Tax Code is amended by changing Sections 21-295 and 22-15 as follows:  (35 ILCS 200/21-295)  Sec. 21-295. Creation of indemnity fund.  (a) In counties of less than 3,000,000 inhabitants, each person purchasing any property at a sale under this Code shall pay to the County Collector, prior to the issuance of any certificate of purchase, a fee of $ 20 for each item purchased. A like sum shall be paid for each year that all or a portion of subsequent taxes are paid by the tax purchaser and posted to the tax judgment, sale, redemption and forfeiture record where the underlying certificate of purchase is recorded.  (a-5) In counties of 3,000,000 or more inhabitants, each person purchasing property at a sale under this Code shall pay to the County Collector a fee of $ 80 for each item purchased plus an additional sum equal to 5% of taxes, interest, and penalties paid by the purchaser, including the taxes, interest, and penalties paid under Section 21-240. In these counties, the certificate holder shall also pay to the County Collector a fee of $ 80 for each year that all or a portion of subsequent taxes are paid by the tax purchaser and posted to the tax judgment, sale, redemption, and forfeiture record, plus an additional sum equal to 5% of all subsequent taxes, interest, and penalties. The additional 5% fees [A> SHALL NOT BE PAID AFTER JUNE 30, 2005 <A] [D> are not required after December 31, 2006 <D] . The changes to this subsection made by this amendatory Act of the 91st General Assembly are not a new enactment, but declaratory of existing law.  (b) The amount paid prior to issuance of the certificate of purchase pursuant to subsection (a) or (a-5) shall be included in the purchase price of the property in the certificate of purchase and all amounts paid under this Section shall be included in the amount required to redeem under Section 21-355. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (b) of Section 21-300, all money received under subsection (a) or (a-5) shall be paid by the Collector to the County Treasurer of the County in which the land is situated, for the purpose of an indemnity fund. The County Treasurer, as trustee of that fund, shall invest all of that fund, principal and income, in his or her hands from time to time, if not immediately required for payments of indemnities under subsection  (a) of Section 21-305, in investments permitted by the Illinois State Board of Investment under Article 22A of the Illinois Pension Code. The county collector shall report annually to the Circuit Court on the condition and income of the fund. The indemnity fund shall be held to satisfy judgments obtained against the County Treasurer, as trustee of the fund. No payment shall be made from the fund, except upon a judgment of the court which ordered the issuance of a tax deed. (Source: P.A. 91-564, eff. 8-14-99; 91-924, eff. 7-7-00.)  (35 ILCS 200/22-15)  Sec. 22-15. Service of notice. The purchaser or his or her assignee shall give the notice required by Section 22-10 by causing it to be published in a newspaper as set forth in Section 22-20. In addition, the notice shall be served by a sheriff (or if he or she is disqualified, by a coroner) of the county in which the property, or any part thereof, is located upon owners who reside on any part of the property sold by leaving a copy of the notice with those owners personally.  In counties of 3,000,000 or more inhabitants where a taxing district is a petitioner for tax deed pursuant to Section 21-90, in lieu of service by the sheriff or coroner the notice may be served by a special process server appointed by the circuit court as provided in this Section. The taxing district may move prior to filing one or more petitions for tax deed for appointment of such a special process server. The court, upon being satisfied that the person named in the motion is at least 18 years of age and is capable of serving notice as required under this Code, shall enter an order appointing such person as a special process server for a period of one year. The appointment may be renewed for successive periods of one year each by motion and order, and a copy of the original and any subsequent order shall be filed in each tax deed case in which a notice is served by the appointed person. Delivery of the notice to and service of the notice by the special process server shall have the same force and effect as its delivery to and service by the sheriff or coroner.  The same form of notice shall also be served upon all other owners and parties interested in the property, if upon diligent inquiry they can be found in the county, and upon the occupants of the property in the following manner:  (a) as to individuals, by (1) leaving a copy of the notice with the [A> INDIVIDUAL <A] [D> person <D] personally or (2) by leaving a copy at his or her usual place of [A> ABODE <A] [D> residence <D] with a person of the family [A> OR A PERSON RESIDING THERE <A] , of the age of 13 years or [A> UPWARDS <A] [D> more <D] , and informing that person of its contents. The [A> OFFICER OR OTHER <A] person making the service shall [A> ALSO SEND <A] [D> cause <D] a copy of the notice [A> IN A SEALED ENVELOPE, WITH POSTAGE FULLY PREPAID, ADDRESSED <A] [D> to be sent by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, <D] to that [A> INDIVIDUAL <A] [D> party <D] at his or her usual place of [A> ABODE <A] [D> residence <D] ;  (b) as to public and private corporations, municipal, governmental and quasi-municipal corporations, partnerships, receivers and trustees of corporations, by leaving a copy of the notice with the person designated by the Civil Practice Law.  If the property sold has more than 4 dwellings or other rental units, and has a managing agent or party who collects rents, that person shall be deemed the occupant and shall be served with notice instead of the occupants of the individual units. If the property has no dwellings or rental units, but economic or recreational activities are carried on therein, the person directing such activities shall be deemed the occupant. Holders of rights of entry and possibilities of reverter shall not be deemed parties interested in the property.  When a party interested in the property is a trustee, notice served upon the trustee shall be deemed to have been served upon any beneficiary or note holder thereunder unless the holder of the note is disclosed of record.  When a judgment is a lien upon the property sold, the holder of the lien shall be served with notice if the name of the judgment debtor as shown in the transcript, certified copy or memorandum of judgment filed of record is identical, as to given name and surname, with the name of the party interested as it appears of record.  If any owner or party interested, upon diligent inquiry and effort, cannot be found or served with notice in the county as provided in this Section, and the person in actual occupancy and possession is tenant to, or in possession under the owners or the parties interested in the property, then service of notice upon the tenant, occupant or person in possession shall be deemed service upon the owners or parties interested.  If any owner or party interested, upon diligent inquiry and effort cannot be found or served with notice in the county, then the person making the service shall cause a copy of the notice to be sent by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, to that party at his or her residence, if ascertainable.

The General Assembly finds and declares that service in the Fire Department requires that firemen, in times of stress and danger [A> , <A] must perform unusual tasks; that by reason of their occupation, firemen are subject to exposure to great heat and to extreme cold in certain seasons while in performance of their duties; that by reason of their employment firemen are required to work in the midst of and are subject to heavy smoke fumes [D> , <D] and carcinogenic, poisonous, toxic or chemical gases from fires [A> ; AND THAT IN THE COURSE OF THEIR RESCUE AND PARAMEDIC DUTIES FIREMEN ARE EXPOSED TO DISABLING INFECTIOUS DISEASES, INCLUDING HIV INFECTION AND HEPATITIS <A] . The General Assembly further finds and declares that all the aforementioned conditions exist and arise out of or in the course of such employment.  Any active fireman who has completed [A> 5 <A] [D> ten <D] or more years of service and is unable to perform his duties in the Fire Department by reason of heart disease, tuberculosis [A> , <A] [D> or <D] any disease of the lungs or respiratory tract, [A> HIV INFECTION, OR HEPATITIS <A] resulting [D> solely <D] from his service as a fireman, shall be entitled to receive an occupational disease disability benefit during any period of such disability for which he does not have a right to receive salary.  Any active fireman who has completed [A> 5 <A] [D> ten <D] or more years of service and is unable to perform his duties in the fire department by reason of a disabling cancer, which develops or manifests itself during a period while the fireman is in the service of the department, shall be entitled to receive an occupational disease disability benefit during any period of such disability for which he does not have a right to receive salary. In order to receive this occupational disease disability benefit, the type of cancer involved must be a type which may be caused by exposure to heat, radiation or a known carcinogen as defined by the International Agency for Research on Cancer.  Any fireman who shall enter the service after the effective date of this amendatory Act shall be examined by one or more practicing physicians appointed by the Board, and if [A> THAT <A] [D> said <D] examination discloses impairment of the heart, lungs [A> , <A] or respiratory tract, or the existence of any [A> HIV INFECTION, HEPATITIS, OR <A] cancer, [A> THEN THE <A] [D> such <D] fireman shall not be entitled to receive [A> AN <A] occupational disease disability benefit unless and until a subsequent examination reveals no such impairment [A> , HIV INFECTION, HEPATITIS, <A] or cancer.  The occupational disease disability benefit shall be 65% of the fireman's salary at the time of his removal from the Department payroll. However, beginning January 1, 1994, no occupational disease disability benefit that has been payable under this Section for at least 10 years shall be less than 50% of the current salary attached from time to time to the rank and grade held by the fireman at the time of his removal from the Department payroll, regardless of whether that removal occurred before the effective date of this amendatory Act of 1993.  Such fireman also shall have a right to receive child's disability benefit of $ 30 per month on account of each unmarried child who is less than 18 years of age or handicapped, dependent upon the fireman for support, and either the issue of the fireman or legally adopted by him. The total amount of child's disability benefit payable to the fireman, when added to his occupational disease disability benefit, shall not exceed 75% of the amount of salary which he was receiving at the time of the grant of occupational disease disability benefit.  The first payment of occupational disease disability benefit or child's disability benefit shall be made not later than one month after the benefit is granted. Each subsequent payment shall be made not later than one month after the date of the latest payment.  Occupational disease disability benefit shall be payable during the period of the disability until the fireman reaches the age of compulsory retirement.
